Hail, Hail, The Everton are here,
What the hell do we care,
What the hell do we care,
Hail, Hail, The Everton are here,
What the hell do we care now ...

For its a Grand Old Team to play for,
For its a Grand Old team to see,
And if you know the history,
It's enough to make your heart go
Woooooooaaaaaaarrrrrrr!!!

We don't care what the REDS**** say,
What the f*** do we care,
For we all know,
That there's going to be a show,
When the Everton boys are there
