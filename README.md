# File Word Counter

This project is a simple Java program that counts the total number of words in a given file. The program prompts the user to enter the name of the file and then reads the file, splits it into words, and counts the total number of words.

# How to use

1. Clone this repository or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open the project in an IDE of your choice or compile the code from the command line.
3. Run the Main class.
4. Enter the name of the file you want to count the words in when prompted by the program.
5. The program will output all the words in the file and the total number of words.

# Note

The path of the file is hardcoded into the program as a variable named filePath. You will need to modify this variable to specify the path of the file on your system.
The program assumes that the words in the file are separated by spaces. If the file uses a different delimiter, you will need to modify the program accordingly.
